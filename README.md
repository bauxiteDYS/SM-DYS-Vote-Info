# SM-DYS-Vote-Info
Sourcemod plugin for Dystopia that prints who didn't vote.

__Notes:__

If someone starts a vote when voting is on cooldown in the game,   
you will have to wait 15s to vote again,   
no matter what the cooldown timer was.  

Also if a vote passes or fails quickly,   
you will still have to wait for the plugin to finish before being able to vote again.
